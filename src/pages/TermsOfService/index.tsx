            <b>Game of Skill.</b> TopProp is a game of skill. Winners are
            determined by the criteria stated in each contest’s rules. For each
            contest, winners are determined by the individuals who use their
            skill and knowledge of relevant League and Association information
            and fantasy sports rules to accumulate the most fantasy points.
            Fantasy points are accumulated through the performance of individual
            athletes in League and Association events.

            In the event of a dispute regarding the identity of the person

            any prize are the sole responsibility of the winner. In the event

            allow the filing of dispositive motions if they are likely to
            efficiently resolve or narrow issues in dispute. The arbitrator’s
            award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be

            The Streamlined Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration may be
            accessed at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at (800) 352-5267. If
            you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, you will be
            required to pay $250 to initiate the arbitration. To the extent the
            filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit,
            the arbitrator may require TopProp to pay the additional cost. You
            are responsible for your own attorneys’ fees unless the arbitration
            rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise. If the arbitrator
            finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, TopProp will pay all of
            the actual filing and arbitrator fees for the arbitration, provided
            your claim does not exceed $75,000. For claims above $75,000, fees
            and costs will be determined in accordance with applicable JAMS
            rules. The arbitration rules permit you to recover attorney’s fees
            in certain cases.

            and the factual allegations on which they are based. The arbitrator
            and/or JAMS may require amendment of any demand or counterclaim that
            does not satisfy these requirements. The arbitrator has the right to
            impose sanctions in accordance with JAMS Rule 24 for any claims the
            arbitrator determines to be frivolous or improper (under the
            standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11).
